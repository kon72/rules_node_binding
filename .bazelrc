# Use a static value for `PATH` and does not inherit `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. Doesn't let environment
# variables like `PATH` sneak into the build, which can cause massive cache misses when they change.
# Use `--action_env=ENV_VARIABLE` if you want to inherit specific environment variables from the
# client, but note that doing so can prevent cross-user caching if a shared cache is used.

# Don't allow network access for build actions in the sandbox.
# Ensures that you don't accidentally make non-hermetic actions/tests which depend on remote
# services.
# Developers should tag targets with `tags=["requires-network"]` to opt-out of the enforcement.

# Allow the Bazel server to check directory sources for changes. Ensures that the Bazel server
# notices when a directory changes, if you have a directory listed in the srcs of some target.
# Recommended when using
# [copy_directory](https://github.com/aspect-build/bazel-lib/blob/main/docs/copy_directory.md) and
# [rules_js](https://github.com/aspect-build/rules_js) since npm package are source directories
# inputs to copy_directory actions.
